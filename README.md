# SimpleGraphicsEngine
##introduction##
with this project i want to school my programming and oranising skills.
all classes contained by this engine where made by myselfe in order to 
improve my programming and algorithm skills.
i dont took the time to test or prove all the methods yet, so if someone 
should use some content, be carefull and try to test content needed by urselfe.
##goal##
1.create a mathematical bibliothek in order to get a basic set of mathematical operations, needed for a 3d grafik engine
2.create a simple grafical engine in java
2.1 the engine should first be able to render simple geometric elements like segments, triangles and vertecies
2.2 the engine should be able to display transparent and non-transparent content
2.3 the engine should provide some different sets of imagefilters to avoid antialiasing effects and a set of filters for blur-effects, etc. 
2.4 the engine should be able to compute shadows and simple light-effects
